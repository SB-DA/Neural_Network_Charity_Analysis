> ## Overview
Machine learning and neural networks enabled us to use Bek's dataset to create an unsupervised binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.
In the past few years, Alphabet Soup has funded more than 34,000 organizations through its business fundraising efforts. Bek has received a CSV file that contains the full list. The dataset contains columns that contain information about each organization.

With the knowledge of Pandas and the StandardScaler() of Scikit-Learn, compile, train, and evaluate a neural network model based on the dataset 

> ## Results

### Data Processing 
- Variable IS_SUCCESSFUL was considered the target for the model.
- APPLICATION_TYPE, AFFILIATION, CLASSIFICATION, USE_CASE, ORGANIZATION, STATUS, INCOME_AMT, SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS, ASK_AMT was considered as the features for the model.
- The columns EIN and NAME were neither targets nor features, so it was removed from the input data.

### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
- How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
- Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
- What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
