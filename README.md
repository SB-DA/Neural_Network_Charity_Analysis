> ## Overview
Machine learning and neural networks enabled us to use Bek's dataset to create an unsupervised binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.
In the past few years, Alphabet Soup has funded more than 34,000 organizations through its business fundraising efforts. Bek has received a CSV file that contains the full list. The dataset contains columns that contain information about each organization.
